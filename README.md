**This kernel is experimental, a lot of dirty work was done to get the kernel working on the device. I will not be responsible for anything that may occur to your device.**

**Releases are only tested to an extent of getting the kernel to boot on the device, features may be broken.**

**I am not a developer, I do not know how to code.**
